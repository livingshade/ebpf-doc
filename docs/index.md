# Welcome to eBPF docs

This is the document about how to implement basic eBPF utility for Rust-based OSs.

We focus on how to seperate eBPF utility from kernel-dependent design.

We assume you have basic understanding about operating systems and eBPF.

> In eBPF overview we define our own eBPF scope.
> zCore implementation is a source code level documentation.
> rCore migration is a step-by-step tutorial to add eBPF support.

This project is generally based on [[this]](https://github.com/latte-c/rCore) work.
